    <!--WinUI packaging and build behavior is determined by:
    WindowsAppSDKWinUI:
        If true, this is the WindowsAppSDK deployment of WinUI, versus the internal legacy deployment for testing only.
        This property is defined by deployment-specific props imports, and should not be overridden by clients.
    WindowsAppSDKFrameworkPackage:
        If not explicitly set to false by a client, WinUI binaries are loaded at runtime from the WindowsAppSDK Framework Package. 
        This property is only applicable when $(WindowsAppSDKWinUI) is true, and is ignored by WinUI targets.
        This property controls target file behavior, and so should only be explicitly set by clients.
